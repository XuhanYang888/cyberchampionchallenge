                    AI systems often gather and analyze massive amounts of general and personal data from the user.
                    From collected data and activity logs, AI can infer sensitive information, such as income, address,
                    preferences, etc. This data can be used by businesses for marketing insights or sold to other
                    companies, potentially leading to privacy breaches and unauthorized data use.

                    AI technologies pose significant cybersecurity risks through identity theft through video and voice
                    generation. These synthetic media technologies can be used to create fake scenes indistinguishable
                    to real ones. With such tools, hackers are able to bypass authentications, ultimately leading to
                    financial exploitation and more.

                    The dependence on AI tools for decision-making could potentially lead to a lack of critical thinking
                    and creativity. The reliance on AI technologies also means the possibility for AI systems to
                    perpetuate existing biases and misleading information, or provide the user with completely
                    detrimental suggestions. For example, if an commonly used AI system had been manipulated to
                    deliberately
                    reduce awareness around certain cyberattack techniques, many people may become vulnerable to
                    cybersecurity
                    breaches.

                    AI-based algorithms can influence what information people are provided with. If its training
                    datasets
                    have been maliciously manipulated, AI technologies could be used to spread misinformation and impact
                    our everyday lifes. This includes societal perceptions, economical trends, political standpoints,
                    etc.
